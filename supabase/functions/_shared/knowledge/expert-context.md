# Expert Knowledge & Best Practices
Last Updated: 2025-10-22

## Current Policy Context

### Federal Incentives (2025)
- **Solar ITC:** No longer available for residential homeowners
- **EV Tax Credits:** $7,500 for new EVs, $4,000 for used; income caps and sourcing requirements apply
- **Energy Efficiency Rebates (HOMES Program):** Up to $8,000 for whole-home retrofits based on energy savings

### Texas State Context
- **No state renewable energy tax credits** (unlike many states)
- **Property tax exemptions** available for solar installations
- **PACE financing** available in some counties for energy improvements
- **Deregulated electricity market** in most of Texas, but Austin is an exception with municipal utility (Austin Energy)

### Austin-Specific Developments
- **Austin Energy Grid:** Moving toward 100% carbon-free by 2035 goal
- **Current renewable mix:** ~40% renewable (solar, wind), increasing annually
- **Climate Equity Plan:** Focus on underserved communities, environmental justice
- **Zero-Waste Goal:** 75% diversion from landfills by 2030
- **Transportation:** Project Connect transit expansion underway

## Research-Based Recommendations

### Transportation Electrification
**Latest Findings:**
- EVs now reach cost parity with gas vehicles by year 3-5 of ownership when including fuel/maintenance savings
- Charging at home costs 60-70% less than gasoline per mile
- Battery technology improving rapidly: 300+ mile range now standard, degradation minimal (<10% after 10 years)
- Used EV market growing: 2019-2021 models now available $15k-25k with 150k+ mile battery warranties

**Best Practices:**
- Recommend Level 2 home charger for daily charging (240V)
- For renters: assess workplace charging and public network density before purchase
- Right-size vehicle to actual needs (smaller EVs more cost-effective than large SUVs)
- Consider hybrid as bridge if charging access limited

### Solar Energy
**Latest Findings:**
- Solar costs down 70% since 2010; now $2.50-3.50/watt installed in Austin
- Battery storage costs dropping rapidly; Tesla Powerwall and competitors at $10k-15k installed
- Modern panels last 25-30 years with minimal degradation (<1%/year)
- Virtual power plant programs emerging: batteries can earn revenue providing grid services
- Federal residential solar tax credit is no longer available; Austin Energy rebates remain

**Best Practices:**
- Solar pays back in 8-12 years in Austin with local rebates (no federal credit)
- Recommend battery storage only for: frequent outages, time-of-use rates, goal of grid independence
- Size system to 100-110% of current usage (not undersized for future EV)
- Must evaluate roof condition first; if re-roofing needed, coordinate timing
- For unsuitable roofs: community solar is viable alternative

### Home Energy Efficiency
**Latest Findings:**
- Air sealing provides highest ROI for efficiency investments (typical $500-1500 investment saves $200-400/year)
- In Austin's climate, AC efficiency and insulation drive 60-70% of energy bills
- Smart thermostats show 10-15% cooling savings on average
- LED lighting now 85% less energy than incandescent, prices dropped below $2/bulb

**Best Practices:**
- Always recommend free energy audit first—professionals identify highest-impact opportunities
- Priority sequence: air sealing → insulation → AC efficiency → windows → appliances
- Don't recommend window replacement for energy alone (20-30 year payback)
- Heat pump water heaters save 50-70% on water heating in Austin climate

### Dietary Impact
**Latest Findings:**
- Beef production creates 20-50x more emissions per calorie than plant-based proteins
- "Meatless Monday" approach (1 day/week plant-based) = 0.3 ton CO₂/year reduction
- Local food claims often overstate climate benefits; what you eat matters far more than where it's from
- Food waste contributes 8% of global emissions; reduction is high-impact

**Best Practices:**
- Frame as "more plants, less beef" rather than strict vegetarian/vegan
- Emphasize co-benefits: health, cost savings ($700-1000/year typical)
- Recommend starting with 1-2 plant-based meals/week
- Connect to Austin's farmers markets and local food culture

## Common Misconceptions to Address

### Solar Myths
❌ "Solar doesn't work on cloudy days"  
✅ Modern panels work in diffuse light; Austin has 235+ sunny days/year anyway

❌ "I'll save money by waiting for better technology"  
✅ Cost of waiting (electricity bills) typically exceeds cost of upgrading later

❌ "Batteries are required for solar to work"  
✅ Grid-tied solar works without batteries; they're optional for backup power

### EV Myths
❌ "EVs don't reduce emissions because electricity is from coal"  
✅ Austin Energy grid is 40%+ renewable and improving; even coal-grid EVs beat gas cars on emissions

❌ "Batteries wear out quickly and cost $15k to replace"  
✅ Modern batteries last 200k-300k miles, warranties cover 8-10 years, degradation minimal

❌ "Charging takes hours, it's inconvenient"  
✅ Most charging happens overnight at home while you sleep; road trips require planning but 150kW+ fast charging now common

### Efficiency Myths
❌ "Small actions like unplugging chargers make a real difference"  
✅ Vampire loads are <2% of home energy use; focus on AC, water heating, appliances

❌ "Natural gas is cleaner than electricity for heating"  
✅ In Austin's grid, heat pumps (electric heating) now lower-emission than gas

## Behavioral Science Insights

### Effective Communication Strategies
- **Lead with co-benefits:** Cost savings, comfort, health, not just climate
- **Make it concrete:** "$80/month savings" not "30% reduction"
- **Avoid overwhelm:** Recommend 1-2 next steps, not comprehensive lists
- **Frame positively:** "Upgrade" not "sacrifice"
- **Social proof:** "Your neighbors have installed..." leverages conformity

### Barriers to Action
1. **Upfront costs:** Address with payback periods, financing options, incentives
2. **Complexity:** Simplify with specific next actions ("Call for free audit")
3. **Status quo bias:** Emphasize "when replacing" not "replace immediately"
4. **Lack of trust:** Cite specific programs, avoid generic advice
5. **Split incentives (renters):** Focus on actions within tenant control

## Ethical Considerations

### Equity and Access
- **Energy burden:** Low-income households spend 3x more of income on energy
- **Prioritize:** Free programs (audits, weatherization) before paid solutions
- **Renters:** 40% of Austin households; focus on transit, efficiency, behavior
- **Digital divide:** Not everyone has internet access to research programs

### Avoiding Greenwashing
- Be honest about impact magnitude: efficiency < solar < EVs for most households
- Don't oversell small actions (reusable bags, bamboo toothbrushes have minimal climate impact)
- Acknowledge trade-offs: manufacturing impacts exist for all technologies
- Avoid "carbon neutral" claims without explaining offsets

## Emerging Trends (2025-2026 Watch List)

- **Vehicle-to-grid (V2G):** EVs as home batteries; pilots starting in Texas
- **Heat pump adoption:** Federal rebates driving residential heat pump HVAC retrofits
- **Community solar expansion:** Growing access for renters and unsuitable roofs
- **Circular economy:** Right-to-repair laws, product longevity requirements gaining traction
- **Climate attribution:** Personalized carbon footprint tools improving in accuracy

### Notes for Administrators

- External resources are fetched asynchronously and won't block recommendations
- If a URL becomes unavailable, the system falls back to static knowledge
- Monitor edge function logs to see which external resources are being used
- Keep the "Refresh" frequency realistic (too frequent = unnecessary bandwidth)
- Consider adding RSS feeds or API endpoints for structured data sources
