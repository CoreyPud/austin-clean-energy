# Clean Energy Priority Framework
Last Updated: 2025-10-22

## Overview
This framework guides AI recommendations based on individual climate impact potential. Rankings are based on Project Drawdown research and IPCC findings, adapted for Austin, Texas context.

## Priority Rankings

### 1. Transportation Electrification
**Impact Score:** 9/10  
**Annual CO₂ Reduction:** 4-6 tons per vehicle  
**Rationale:** Electric vehicles eliminate the largest source of individual carbon emissions. The average driver produces 4.6 tons of CO₂ annually from gasoline combustion. EVs powered by Austin's grid (which is increasingly renewable) eliminate these emissions entirely.  
**Austin Context:** Growing charging infrastructure, Austin Energy EV rates available, multiple federal and state incentives active.  
**Key Barriers:** Upfront cost, charging access for renters, range anxiety  
**Current Incentives:** Federal EV tax credit up to $7,500, Austin Energy rebates for home charging equipment

### 2. Zero-Carbon Home Power (Solar + Clean Grid)
**Impact Score:** 8/10  
**Annual CO₂ Reduction:** 3-5 tons per household  
**Rationale:** Residential solar combined with clean grid electricity eliminates home energy emissions. Austin Energy's grid is moving toward renewable sources, making this increasingly effective.  
**Austin Context:** Excellent solar conditions (235+ sunny days/year), Austin Energy solar buyback program  
**Key Barriers:** Roof condition/ownership, HOA restrictions, upfront costs  
**Current Incentives:** Austin Energy solar rebates up to $2,500

### 3. Home Energy Efficiency
**Impact Score:** 7/10  
**Annual CO₂ Reduction:** 1-3 tons per household  
**Rationale:** Reducing energy consumption through efficiency measures (insulation, air sealing, efficient HVAC) prevents emissions and saves money. In Austin's climate, AC efficiency is critical.  
**Austin Context:** Hot climate makes cooling efficiency especially impactful, free home energy audits available, weatherization assistance for qualifying households  
**Key Barriers:** Lack of awareness, upfront investment, difficulty finding qualified contractors  
**Current Incentives:** Free energy audits, Austin Energy rebates for AC/insulation upgrades, weatherization grants for low-income households

### 4. Sustainable Transportation Options
**Impact Score:** 6/10  
**Annual CO₂ Reduction:** 1-4 tons depending on mode shift  
**Rationale:** Biking, transit, carpooling, and telecommuting reduce vehicle miles traveled. Impact varies greatly based on baseline commute distance and frequency.  
**Austin Context:** Expanding bike infrastructure, CapMetro transit system, growing remote work culture  
**Key Barriers:** Limited transit coverage, hot climate, car-centric city design  
**Current Incentives:** Free CapMetro employer programs, bike-share subsidies, HOV lane access for carpools

### 5. Dietary Changes (Plant-Rich Diet)
**Impact Score:** 5/10  
**Annual CO₂ Reduction:** 0.5-2 tons depending on current diet  
**Rationale:** Food production, especially meat and dairy, creates significant emissions. Shifting toward plant-rich diets reduces agricultural emissions and land use.  
**Austin Context:** Strong local food culture, farmers markets, growing plant-based restaurant scene  
**Key Barriers:** Cultural habits, taste preferences, nutritional concerns, cost perception  
**Current Incentives:** None directly, but local food co-ops and farmers markets make sustainable food accessible

### 6. Waste Reduction and Recycling
**Impact Score:** 4/10  
**Annual CO₂ Reduction:** 0.5-1.5 tons per household  
**Rationale:** Reducing consumption, reusing items, and proper recycling prevent manufacturing emissions and methane from landfills. Composting organic waste is particularly impactful.  
**Austin Context:** Strong zero-waste initiatives, composting programs, repair/reuse culture  
**Key Barriers:** Convenience, lack of access to recycling/composting, confusion about what's recyclable  
**Current Incentives:** Free curbside composting in some areas, City recycling programs, repair cafes

### 7. Water Conservation
**Impact Score:** 3/10  
**Annual CO₂ Reduction:** 0.2-0.8 tons per household  
**Rationale:** Water treatment and heating consume energy. Conservation reduces both. In drought-prone Austin, water efficiency is critical for resilience beyond climate impact.  
**Austin Context:** Frequent drought conditions, water restrictions common, Austin Water rebate programs  
**Key Barriers:** Habit change, upfront costs for efficient fixtures, lack of visibility into water use  
**Current Incentives:** Austin Water rebates for efficient fixtures, free water audits, rainwater harvesting incentives

### 8. Green Building and Renovation
**Impact Score:** 7/10 (for new construction/major renovation)  
**Annual CO₂ Reduction:** 2-4 tons per household  
**Rationale:** Energy-efficient design, sustainable materials, and passive strategies create long-term emissions reductions. Most impactful when building new or doing major renovations.  
**Austin Context:** Austin Energy Green Building program well-established, growing green building industry  
**Key Barriers:** Higher upfront costs, finding qualified builders, design complexity  
**Current Incentives:** Austin Energy Green Building incentives, faster permitting for green builds, property tax exemptions for solar

## Geographic Context
Austin, Texas specific factors:
- **Climate:** Hot summers (cooling-dominated), mild winters
- **Grid:** Austin Energy moving toward renewables (40%+ renewable in 2024)
- **Transportation:** Car-dependent city with growing bike/transit infrastructure
- **Housing:** Mix of older homes needing efficiency upgrades and new development
- **Policy:** Relatively progressive climate policies, strong renewable energy goals
